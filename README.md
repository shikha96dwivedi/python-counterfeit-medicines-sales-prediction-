Counterfeit medicines are fake medicines which are either contaminated or contain wrong or no active ingredient. They could have the right active ingredient but at the wrong dose. Counterfeit drugs are illegal and are harmful to health. 10% of the world's medicine is counterfeit and the problem is even worse in developing countries. Up to 30% of medicines in developing countries are counterfeit. Government has decided that they should focus on illegal operations of high net worth first instead of trying to control all of them. 
The task here is to build a predictive model for predicting sales figures given other information related to counterfeit medicine selling operations. You need to build your model on the train data set. Test data set does not have a response column; you need to predict those values.
